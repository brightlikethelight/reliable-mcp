# MCP Reliability Lab - WORKING FUNCTIONALITY

## What Actually Works Now

After the fixes, here's what's **actually functioning**:

### ✅ Core MCP Client
```python
from mcp_client import MCPClient

# This now works!
client = MCPClient('filesystem')
await client.start()
tools = await client.list_tools()  # Returns 14 tools
await client.call_tool('write_file', {...})
await client.stop()
```

### ✅ Basic Examples
```bash
# Example 01 now works
cd examples
python3 01_basic_test.py
# Successfully connects, writes, reads files
```

### ✅ Configuration
- Cross-platform temp directories
- Resolved path issues on macOS
- Centralized configuration in `config.py`

### ✅ Available MCP Servers
```bash
# Currently installed and working:
- @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem  # ✅ Working
- @modelcontextprotocol/server-github      # Needs GITHUB_TOKEN
- @modelcontextprotocol/inspector          # Testing tool
```

## What's Partially Working

### ⚠️ Test Runner Service
- Initializes successfully
- Runs tests but metrics calculation needs work
- Database storage works

### ⚠️ Benchmarking
- Runs benchmarks
- Has issues with some metrics
- Workload patterns defined

### ⚠️ Web UI
- FastAPI app starts
- Templates exist
- Needs testing with fixed imports

## What Still Needs Work

### ❌ Scientific Testing
- Property testing framework exists but untested
- Chaos engineering code exists but untested
- State machine testing defined but not implemented

### ❌ Additional MCP Servers
- Only filesystem server tested
- Need to add PostgreSQL, Slack, etc.

### ❌ Production Packaging
- Docker setup exists but untested
- PyPI package defined but not published

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test basic MCP connectivity
python3 -c "
import asyncio
from mcp_client import MCPClient

async def test():
    client = MCPClient('filesystem')
    await client.start()
    tools = await client.list_tools()
    print(f'Found {len(tools)} tools')
    await client.stop()

asyncio.run(test())
"

# Run working example
cd examples
python3 01_basic_test.py

# Try the demo (partially works)
python3 demo.py
```

## Summary

**Before fixes:**
- 0% of examples worked
- MCP client couldn't connect
- Import errors everywhere

**After fixes:**
- Basic MCP operations work
- Examples run successfully
- File operations function correctly
- Cross-platform paths resolved

The foundation is now **actually working** and can be built upon!
